        <h2>Returns & refunds</h2>
        <p>
            Blue Meridian Ltd primarily sells through online marketplaces such as Amazon. When a
            purchase is made through a marketplace, returns and refunds are processed according to
            that marketplace’s policies and the applicable consumer law in the country of purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
            Customers should initiate any return or refund request directly through the marketplace
            where the order was placed, using the tools provided on that platform.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="shipping">
        <h2>Shipping & delivery</h2>
        <p>
            Orders are typically fulfilled using marketplace fulfilment solutions or third-party
            logistics providers. Delivery times, tracking information and shipping options depend on
            the marketplace, the customer’s location and the product involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specific delivery information is shown on each listing at the time of purchase.

            We only collect and process the personal data necessary to operate our business, manage

        <p>
            We do not sell or share customer data with third parties for marketing purposes. Data
            may be stored with service providers that support our operations (for example, logistics,
            IT or cloud infrastructure providers), always under appropriate safeguards.
