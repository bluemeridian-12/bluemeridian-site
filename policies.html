        <h2>Returns &amp; refunds</h2>
        <p>
            Blue Meridian Ltd sells primarily through online marketplaces such as Amazon. When purchases
            are made through these platforms, returns and refunds are handled in accordance with the
            marketplace policies and the applicable consumer law in the country of purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
            Customers should initiate any return or refund request directly through the marketplace where
            the order was placed, following the instructions provided there.

        <h2>Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            We only collect and process personal data that is necessary to operate our business, to fulfil
            orders and to comply with legal obligations. When sales are made via marketplaces, most customer
            data is processed within those platforms, in line with their own privacy policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not sell or share customer data with third parties for marketing purposes. Data may be
            stored with service providers that support our operations (for example, logistics or IT
            infrastructure providers), always under appropriate safeguards.
