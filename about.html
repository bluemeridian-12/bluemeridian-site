        <h2>About Blue Meridian Ltd</h2>
        <p>
            Blue Meridian Ltd is a private limited company registered in England and Wales and focused on
            building structured e-commerce operations for consumer products.

            Our role is to design and run the operational backbone of online retail: product sourcing,
            marketplace setup, catalogue optimisation and logistics coordination using third-party
            fulfilment solutions such as FBA-style warehouses.

            The company currently operates from London, United Kingdom, with a long-term strategy of
            expanding its portfolio of brands and product lines while maintaining a low-risk, compliance-first
            approach.
