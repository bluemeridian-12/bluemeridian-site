    <!-- WHO WE ARE -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container narrow">
        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          Blue Meridian Ltd is a UK registered e-commerce company dedicated to developing, acquiring and operating consumer products within the Amazon marketplace.
          We act as operators, not as a service agency. Our work is centred on our own portfolio of products and brands.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company was created with a simple premise: run a lean, disciplined and transparent operation, with clear processes and a long term view on every product line we launch.

          <div>
            <p>
              We focus on Amazon FBA UK as our primary sales channel. Instead of trying to be present everywhere at once, we concentrate resources on understanding the dynamics of this specific marketplace and operating within it with precision.

              <li>Own brands and product lines only</li>

              We do not offer account management services and we do not operate third party brands.  
              All of our internal processes are designed around the responsibility of owning the products, the stock and the customer relationship through Amazon.

            </p>

              Operating as a UK company means aligning to local regulation and fiscal standards, as well as to Amazon marketplace policies.

          Blue Meridian is intentionally built as a compact structure.

          As the company grows, we plan to expand our portfolio and team gradually, maintaining the same principles of discipline, transparency and long term orientation.
